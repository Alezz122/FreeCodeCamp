        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
          simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
          together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
          development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for
          all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same
          site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools,
          and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
          languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul class="list2">
          <li>A general understanding about the IDE's and the OS</li>
          <li>Some experience with programming before</li>
          <li></li>

      <article>
        <p>What are data types?</p>
        <p>Data types are the classification or categorization of knowledge items. It represents the type useful that
          tells what operations are often performed on specific data. Since everything is an object in Python
          programming, data types are classes and variables are instances (object) of those classes.</p>
        <p>Data types are an important concept within the python programing language. Every value has its own python
          data type, in the python programming language. The classification of knowledge items or to place the info
          value into some kind of data category is named Data Types. It helps to know what quiet operations are often
          performed on a worth.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <h3>Integers</h3>
            <p>This data type is represented with the help of int class. It consists of positive or negative whole
              numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python, there’s no limit to how long integer values are often.
            </p>
            <pre><code>b = 5 print
(b, "is of type", type(b))
Output: 5 is of type</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Float</h3>
            <p>This type is represented by the float class. It is a true number with floating-point representation. It
              is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative
              integer could even be appended to specify scientific notation.</p>
            <pre><code>b = 1.5
print(b, "is of type", type(b))
Output: 1.5 is of type
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Complex Numbers</h3>
            <p>Complex numbers are represented by complex classes. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j,
              For example – 4+5j.</p>
            <pre><code>c = 8+3j
print(c, "is a type", type(c))
Output: (8+3j) is a type
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>String</h3>
            <p>The string is a sequence of Unicode characters. A string may be a collection of 1 or more characters put
              during a quotation mark, double-quote, or triple quote. It can be represented using an str class.</p>
            <pre><code>string1 = “Hello World” 
print(string1) 
output: Hello World</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>List</h3>
            <p>A list is formed(or created) by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [ ], separated by
              commas.
              It can have any number of items and they may or may not be of different types (integer, float, string,
              etc.).
              A list is mutable, which suggests we will modify the list</p>
            <pre><code>List1 = [3,8,7.2,"Hello"]
print("List1[2] = ", List[2])
Output:  List1[2] = 7.2
print("List1[1:3] = ", List[1:3])
Output: List1[1:3] = [8, 7.2]</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Tuple</h3>
            <p>A tuple is defined as an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list
              is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples can’t be modified after it’s created. It is represented by tuple
              class. we can represent tuples using parentheses ( ).</p>
            <pre><code>Tuple = (25,10,12.5,"Hello") 
print("Tuple[1] = ", Tuple[1]) 
Output: Tuple[1] =  10 
print("Tuple[0:3] =", Tuple[0:3]) 
Output: Tuple[0:3] =  (25,10,12.5) </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Set</h3>
            <p>A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is exclusive (no duplicates) and must be
              immutable (cannot be changed).</p>
            <pre><code>Set = {4,3,6.6,"Hello"} 
print(Set) 
Output: {"Hello", 3, 4, 6.6}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dictionary</h3>
            <p>In Python, Dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, which is used to store data values like
              a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a Dictionary consists
              of key-value pair. Key-value is provided within the dictionary to form it more optimized. In the
              representation of a dictionary data type, each key-value pair during a Dictionary is separated by a colon:
              whereas each key’s separated by a ‘comma’.</p>
            <pre><code>Dict1 = {1:'Hello',2:5.5, 3:'World'} 
print(Dict1) 
Output: {1: ‘Hello’, 2: 5.5, 3: ‘World’}</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>Variables are areas in RAM where we can store one value. Each variable has a variable name (also known as an
        identifier). We use the variable name to refer to the value stored in the variable.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <pre><code>variableName = value</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 1 - Store a name</h3>
      <pre><code>name = 'Smith'</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 2 - Store a number</h3>
      <pre><code>age = 15</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 3 - Store a current state of a game</h3>
      <pre><code>game = 'Smith'</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 4 - Store a calculation</h3>
      <pre><code>base = 20 
height = 15 
triangleArea = (1/2) * base * height 
print(triangleArea)</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section id="constants" class="main-section">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as
          containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.</p>
        <p>You can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag.
        </p>
        <pre><code>PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8
print(constant.PI)
print(constant.GRAVITY)

Output:
3.14
9.8</code></pre>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="if_else_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>If else statement</header>
      <p>An if statement allows you to run different blocks of code depending on a condition.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <pre>
<code>if condition:
    print('this block of code runs if condition is True') 
elif condition2: 
    print('this block of code runs if condition2 is True') 
elif condition3: 
    print('this block of code runs if condition3 is True') 
else: 
    print('this block of code runs if none of the other conditions were True') </code></pre>
      <h3>Example 1 - IF with Boolean only</h3>
      <pre><code>gameOver = True    #The gameOver variable is a flag which stores True if the game has finished. 
    if gameOver: 
        print('Sorry - you lost')</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 2 - IF with comparison operator</h3>
      <pre><code>age = 15 
if age < 18: 
    print('You are not an adult yet')</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>While Statement</header>
      <p>A while loop will continue to repeat a block of code while some condition is true. It checks the condition at
        the start of each loop and if it is False then it doesn’t run the block of code.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <code>


      </code>
      <h3>Example 1 - While to check a string</h3>
      <pre><code>userPassword = ''
while userPassword != 'secret': 
    userPassword = input('Type in your password: ') 
print('Access granted!') </code></pre>
      <h3>Example 2 - While with a flag - to continue playing a game</h3>
      <pre><code>playGame = True 
while playGame: 
    print('We are playing the game') 
    playAgain = input('Would you like to playAgain? ') 
    if playAgain == 'n' or playAgain == 'no': 
    playGame = False  
print('Thank you for playing')</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 3 - An infinite loop</h3>
      <pre><code>while True: 
print('hello')</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section id="function_declarations" class="main-section">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <p>A function is a block of code which is executed when it is called from somewhere in the program. A function
        will return a value.</p>
      <p>Functions are perfect for abstraction. They allow us to write blocks of code which can be reused in different
        ways and in different programs.</p>
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <pre><code>#define the function 
def functionName(arg1, arg2, ...): 
    print('put instructions here') 
    return value      
#call the procedure 
procedureName()</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 1 - Function to return a value</h3>
      <pre><code>def pi():           #define the function 
    return 3.14     #return a value 
pi = pi() 
print(pi)</code></pre>
      <h3>Example 2 - Using an argument with a function</h3>
      <pre><code>def ageInDays(years):   #years is the argument (input) given to the function 
days = years * 365  #the 'days' variable is only available in this function 
return days         #return the days variable 

ageYears = int(input('How old are you? ')) 

ageDays = ageInDays(ageYears)   #call the function and assign the result to the variable 'agedays' 

print(ageDays) </code></pre>
      <h3>Example 3 - Function to return a choice made in a menu</h3>
      <pre><code>def getMenuChoice(): 
    print('Main Menu') 
    print('1. Play game') 
    print('2. View high scores') 
    print('3. Quit') 
    
    choice = input('Please enter your choice as a number: ') 
    
    return choice 
    
    
chosenItem = getMenuChoice() 

print(chosenItem) </code></pre>
